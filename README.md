# Shop-Cart
Shop-Cart is Flask based web application which allows user to shop for electronic gadgets like headset, earpods, television and other product like cooking utensils. It is an complete falsk based application. It makes use of flask-login, sqlalchemy, usermixin to make website functional.It also contains admin panel where you can add products, view ordrs , update their status which get refletes in user login. If you are running it on same pc then , I highly recommended to use incognito for opening admin panel or else you can use two diferent devices.


Use email-id : admin@gmail.com 
password : admin@123 to login as admin

For setting up project in virtual environment use : python3 -m venv venv
